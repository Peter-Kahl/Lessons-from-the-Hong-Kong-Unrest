## Abstract

This working paper argues that the failure of Hong Kong’s 2019–20 mobilisation was epistemic before it was political. While millions sympathised with the movement, only a minority sustained dissent. The paradox is explained by integrating _Epistemic Clientelism Theory_ with a reconceptualisation of _cognitive dissonance as an epistemic event_. Protest participation depended not simply on material costs or tactical choices, but on whether individuals could endure contradiction without collapsing into conformity, silence, or exit.

The analysis shows how fiduciary–epistemic scaffolds — universities, professional bodies, and media — failed or inverted, leaving citizens structurally and psychologically isolated. Without institutional buffers, the burdens of contradiction and fear were redistributed downward: youth and precarious actors disproportionately endured trauma and long-term mental health risks, while professionals rationalised withdrawal or exit.

Situating Hong Kong in a comparative frame — Belarus, Iran, Taiwan, South Korea, and even established democracies — reveals the same dynamics of scaffold collapse or resilience. The normative conclusion is that freedom is not independence but bounded freedom: fragile autonomy sustained only when fiduciary–epistemic scaffolds dignify dependence, enabling plurality to survive both material repression and psychological fear.
